We are using code (*borrowed*) from the following projects:
./plugins/mlia.py - https://github.com/infinitylabs/UguuBot
./plugins/horoscope.py - https://github.com/infinitylabs/UguuBot
color section in ./plugins/utility.py - https://github.com/hitzler/homero

Special Thanks:
Rmmh (created skybot!)
lahwran (for his advice and stuff I stole from his skybot fork!)
TheNoodle (for helping with some plugins when I was first starting out)

If any of your code is in here and you don't have credit, I'm sorry. I didn't keep track of a lot of code I added in the early days of the project.

You are all awesome :)

# CloudBot Refresh

## About

CloudBot Refresh is an updated version of CloudBot, the python IRC bot origially based on [Skybot](http://git.io/skybot) by [rmmh](http://git.io/rmmh).

## Getting and using CloudBot

### Download 

Get CloudBot at [https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/zipball/3.4-refactoring](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/zipball/3.4-refactoring "Get CloudBot from Github!").

Unzip the resulting file, and continue to read this document.

### Install

Before you can run the bot, you need to install a few Python dependencies. lxml, watchdog, sqlalchemy and BeautifulSoup4
are required by CloudBot. `pyenchant`, `pydns`, `pygeoip`, `tweepy`, `pycrypto` and `pbkdf2` are also required for various plugins.

Make sure you're running python version **3.4** or higher.

These can be installed with `pip` (The Python package manager) by running the following command in the bot directory:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

**Note:** If you use `pip`, you will also need the following packages on linux or `pip` will fail to install the requirements.

```
python, python-dev, libenchant-dev, libenchant1c2a, libxslt-dev, libxml2-dev.
```

(this can be done using your package manager (eg: *apt-get* or *yum*)

#### How to install `pip`

You can usually install pip on linux by installing the `python-pip` package using your package manager (eg. *apt-get install python-pip* or *yum install python-pip* as root), or you can try the below code to download and install it manually.

    curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py # or download with your browser on windows
    python distribute_setup.py
    easy_install pip

If you need help installing pip on Windows, follow [this guide](http://simpledeveloper.com/how-to-install-easy_install/) and then run `easy_install pip` on the command line.


Note for **Windows** users: Windows compatibility some modules is **broken** (such as ping), but we do intend to add it, eventually.

### Run

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid on [this site](http://jsonlint.com/)!

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

`python3.4 -m cloudbot`

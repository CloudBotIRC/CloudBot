# CloudBot

CloudBot is a simple, fast, expandable open-source Python IRC Bot!

## Getting CloudBot

There are currently four different branches of this repository, each with a different level of stability:
 - **gonzobot** *(stable)*: This branch contains everything in the **master** branch plus additional plugins added for Snoonet IRC.
 - **gonzobot-dev** *(unstable)*: This branch is based off of the **gonzobot** branch and includes new plugins that are not fully tested.
 - **master** *(stable)*: This branch contains stable, tested code. This is the branch you should be using if you just want to run your own CloudBot! This is also the branch that EDI on Snoonet uses.
 - **python3.4** *(unstable)*: This branch is where where test and develop new features. If you would like to help develop CloudBot, you can use this branch.

New releases will be pushed from **python3.4** to **master** whenever we have a stable version to release. These changes will be merged into **gonzobot** then deployed. This should happen on a fairly regular basis, so you'll never be too far behind the latest improvements.

## Installing CloudBot

Firstly, CloudBot will only run on **Python 3.4 or higher**. Because we use the asyncio module, you will not be able to use any other versions of Python.

To install CloudBot on *nix (linux, etc), see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-*nix)

To install CloudBot on Windows, see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-Windows)


### Running CloudBot

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default.json` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

```
python3.4 -m cloudbot
```

Note that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.
```
python3.4 CloudBotRefresh/cloudbot/__main__.py
```
Specify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.

# CloudBot Docs

Welcome to CloudBot! This set of documentation is split into three folders.

### Folder Structure

 - User: The users folder holds all the documentation for setting up a new CloudBot client instance, as well as the required configurations and needed APIs/external softwares.
 - Dev: The devs folder contains documention for developers who wish to get a reference of the CloudBot API and code paradigms.
 - Etc: This folder holds all the stuff that didn't relate to any of the other two at all.

For each set of docs, a PDF and HTML version is also available.

## Refresh

Refresh (this repo) is the newest CloudBot, which cleans up the internals of the bot and brings support for Python 3.4.
